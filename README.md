## About This Game
> This Tic-Tac-Toe game is my first project using JavaScript.
> When I designed this game first I wanted to focus on JavaScript more than on CSS
>  I added a timer function which users can set up before they start a game.
> If a user does not select a cube within the time allowed she/he will lose the round.
> When they start a game if a first user does not select a color, she/he will play with red.
> I hope you enjoy this game.
